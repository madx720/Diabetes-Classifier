# Diabetes Data Classifier

This project demonstrates how to build a classifier to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The model is built using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual has diabetes based on various health measurements. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the DiabetesDataClassifier.ipynb file.

2. Ensure you have the dataset diabetes.csv in your working directory.

3. Run the notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
